# FlickrSearch

Work-in-progress for a forthcoming blog post on unit-testing fundamentals.

This app was sourced from a [Ray Wenderlich tutorial on `UICollectionView`s](https://www.raywenderlich.com/78550/beginning-ios-collection-views-swift-part-1) and is mostly unmodified save for the following:

  * Update to Swift 3.0
  * Addition of `ApiKeys.swift` and `ApiKeys.plist`. If you'd like to run the code as intended, please add an `ApiKeys.plist` file with your own Flickr API key (currently part of my .gitignore).

Watch this space for updates!
