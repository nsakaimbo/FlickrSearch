# FlickrSearch

Work-in-progress for a forthcoming blog post on unit-testing fundamentals.

This app was sourced from a [Ray Wenderlich tutorial on `UICollectionView`s](https://www.raywenderlich.com/78550/beginning-ios-collection-views-swift-part-1) and is mostly unmodified save for the following:

  * Update to Swift 3.0 (requires Xcode 8 beta. Side note: am I crazy to add tests using beta tools??? ðŸ¤” I'll chalk it up as part of the learning experience!)
  * Addition of `ApiKeys.swift` and `ApiKeys.plist`. If you'd like to run the code as intended, please add an `ApiKeys.plist` file of your own with a `FlickrAPIKey` requested from the Flick developer portal (this file is currently part of my .gitignore to hide my own API credentials).

Watch this space for updates!
